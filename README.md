# Zomato-Analysis-Interactive-Dashboard-Power-BI
## Project Description:
This project involves the creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Zomato sales data. The dashboard provides key insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency. It enables data-driven decision-making by visualizing trends, patterns, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

### Key Features:

* Data Source: The data is sourced from Zomato's public dataset.
* Data Cleaning and Transformation: The data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query Editor in Power BI to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
* Data Modeling: A star schema data model was implemented to optimize the relationships between different tables.
* KPIs: Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, average order value, the number of orders, and customer retention rate are calculated and displayed.
* Visualizations: The dashboard includes a variety of visualizations, including:
* Sales by city and restaurant and price range by cuisines (Clustered column chart and clustered bar chart)
* Count of restaurants by Country name (pie chart)
* Order analysis (tables and matrices)
* Interactive Filters and Slicers: Users can filter and slice the data by date range, city, restaurant, and other relevant dimensions to explore specific segments.
* DAX Measures: Complex calculations and business logic are implemented using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create insightful metrics.

### Technologies Used:

* Power BI
* Power Query Editor
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

### Data Source:

* Zomato's public dataset

### How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Power BI file (.pbix) using Power BI Desktop.
3. Interact with the dashboard to explore the data.

### Future Enhancements:

* Implement more advanced data analysis techniques.
* Integrate additional data sources.
* Create a mobile-optimized version of the dashboard.
